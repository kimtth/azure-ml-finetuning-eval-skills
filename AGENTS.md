You have additional SKILLs documented in directories containing a "SKILL.md" file.

These skills are:
 - azure-ml-llm-trainer -> "skills/azure-ml-llm-trainer/SKILL.md"
 - azure-ml-dataset-creator -> "skills/azure-ml-dataset-creator/SKILL.md"
 - azure-ml-model-evaluation -> "skills/azure-ml-model-evaluation/SKILL.md"

IMPORTANT: You MUST read the SKILL.md file whenever the description of the skills matches the user intent, or may help accomplish their task.

<available_skills>

azure-ml-llm-trainer: `Train or fine-tune LLMs entirely on Azure Machine Learning managed compute using the sample command-job workflow (no Hugging Face Jobs).`

azure-ml-dataset-creator: `Generate synthetic and simulated datasets for evaluation and fine-tuning using Azure AI Foundry simulators. Create non-adversarial task data, adversarial safety data, and conversation datasets.`

azure-ml-model-evaluation: `Evaluate generative AI applications and models locally or in the cloud using Azure AI Evaluation SDK. Measure quality, safety, and performance with built-in and custom evaluators.`

Paths referenced within SKILL folders are relative to that SKILL. For example the azure-ml-llm-trainer sample/src/train_sft.py would be referenced as `sample/src/train_sft.py`.
